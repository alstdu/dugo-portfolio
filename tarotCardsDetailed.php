    <h2>Process</h2>
    <div class="glass-effect section artifact-section artifact-section-grid artifact-process">
        <p>My goal for this project was to create a modern online Tarot Card Picker with my own card designs. Most
            online tarot card picker websites are not very usable due to the number of ads and other pop ups.
            They can be cluttered, and the design isn’t optimal for everyone to use.
            I wanted to showcase my interest in spirituality, as well as my ability to perform basic but effective
            JavaScript. I included a unique element where you can choose how many cards to draw instead of the default
            one card.
            <br>
            This was a project very close to my heart, as this was my very first developer project when I was first
            learning the basics of JavaScript - long before I arrived at
            BCIT. I always used a physical deck, and I’ve tried some tarot apps, but I knew I could create something
            pretty cool for myself and others.

        <p>I created a brainstorm of things I would need to do to improve the code and account for the scope increase
            from the original.</p>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <div class="glass-effect section artifact-section artifact-section-grid artifact-challenges">
        <p>Since I admittedly started this a bit later than anticipated, I had to reduce the scope for the sake of deadlines. 
            However, I do plan to upgrade this eventually, and have even started working through the code. I went
            from 1, 2 or 3 cards to just 1 card for now. I’m sure as I'm continuing iteration 2, I will have an entirely new set of
            challenges to work through, such as working on better understanding this monstrosity. Stay Tuned for iteration two
            which will be talked about below this section once it's complete!

        <p>post editing note: I actually did take some time to understand this! However, I ended up not needing it.</p>
