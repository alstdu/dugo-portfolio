        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>For my project management course, we were tasked with coming up with a fictional business and creating branding, wireframes, and a website using the scrum methodology.  The whole project was done using a 5 week sprint structure. I created the template for our All In One Google Sheet which included time logs, our backlog, sprints, and burndown charts.</p>

        <p>We started by creating user stories and prioritizing those tasks in our backlog and weekly sprints.</p>

        <p>Development started in sprint 2, and in sprint 3 my teammate Manh helped with code reviews and creating the contact page. We learned about merging and pull requests and had some practice reviewing and managing branches.</p>

        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>Most of the challenges I encountered were related to making certain elements accessible. This was the first project in which I took a deep dive into accessible elements.</p>
        <p>I used many resources to help guide decision making such as <a>Aditus’ guide on accessible accordion menus</a>, <a>MDN’s documentation</a> on forms and inputs, and multiple sources for how to style radio buttons without the checkbox.</p>

        <h2>Post-Coutse Additions</h2>
        <p>After the course was completed, I added some SEO markup to the HTML to practice implementing structured data markup and metadata.</p>

        <p>Our New Media Marketing class taught us about the importance of SEO and how crawlers search webpages for different types of data. We also learned how to make a marketing plan from start to finish.</p>
